Version 1.0: 2023-05-21

This mod cleans up unnecessary data from Savegames, leading to much faster play on games after 10+ years.

It removes things from the Savegame that causes bloat. Should be savegame-compatible.
Everything that is removed is toggleable in the Mod Settings.

It typically reduces file sizes to 10-20 MB, largely dependent on how many pawns and items you have
in your bases.

Backups are made before each shrinking operation, so you can rest secure.
